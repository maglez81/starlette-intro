####  starlette - https://www.starlette.io/
Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building async web services in Python.

####  asgi - https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a spiritual successor to WSGI, intended to provide a standard interface between async-capable Python web servers, frameworks, and applications.

####  async - https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html
The async keyword is used to define a coroutine function

####  assert - https://realpython.com/python-assert-statement/
The assert keyword is used when debugging code. The assert keyword lets you test if a condition in your code returns True, if not, the program will raise an AssertionError.

####  await - https://agariinc.medium.com/strategies-for-testing-async-code-in-python-c52163f2deab
The await keyword is used to wait for the eventual results of the object returned by such a function

####  middleware - https://oz123.github.io/advanced-python/book/middlewares.html
A middleware is an object that wrapps the original application, hence the name. A middle is called between the application and the server. It can modify the response or the environment or route requests to different application objects.

####  jinja - https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/intro/
Jinja is a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. Then the template is passed data to render the final document.

####  Mangum - https://github.com/jordaneremieff/mangum
Mangum is an adapter for running ASGI applications in AWS Lambda to handle Function URL, API Gateway, ALB, and Lambda@Edge events. Documentation: https://mangum.io/
