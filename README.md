ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a spiritual successor to WSGI, intended to provide a standard interface between async-capable Python web servers, frameworks, and applications.

## async - https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html
============================================================\
The async keyword is used to define a coroutine function

## assert - https://realpython.com/python-assert-statement/
============================================================\
The assert keyword is used when debugging code. The assert keyword lets you test if a condition in your code returns True, if not, the program will raise an AssertionError.

## await - https://agariinc.medium.com/strategies-for-testing-async-code-in-python-c52163f2deab
====================================================================================================\
The await keyword is used to wait for the eventual results of the object returned by such a function

## middleware - https://oz123.github.io/advanced-python/book/middlewares.html
====================================================================================\
A middleware is an object that wrapps the original application, hence the name. A middle is called between the application and the server. It can modify the response or the environment or route requests to different application objects.
